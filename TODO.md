# TODO

Other things I want to learn how to do with Ebiten:

- Turn based: Separate update/draw from the game loop, run update only when the
  user makes its turn (say, when spacebar is pressed)
- Easier polygons, perhaps a small pkg with basic utils to do triangles,
  squares, lines and circles, and things like that? Check:
  https://github.com/hajimehoshi/ebiten/blob/v1.11.7/ebitenutil/shapes.go
- Test build to browser and how it works (gopherjs and/or wasm)
