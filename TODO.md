# TODO

Other things I want to learn how to do with Ebiten:

- Build a random starfield. Assign to each star a random "distance" and on
  scrolling, make the "far" ones move slower than the "closer" ones. So parallax
  layers basically, but each star has its own "depth". See what happens if
  assigning also a "direction" to simulate the camera position relative to those
  stars when scrolling. This direction could be a simple "with" or "against" the
  scrolling direction.
- Test build to browser and how it works (gopherjs and/or wasm)
